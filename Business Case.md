# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction: A Business Case Study
## Project Objective

The Melbourne housing market is known for its volatility and complexity, making accurate property valuation a critical component for real estate firms, investors, and homebuyers. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for estimating housing prices, providing a valuable tool for strategic decision-making.

## Key Business Problem:

How can real estate companies and investors optimize their pricing strategies and identify lucrative property investment opportunities in a competitive housing market?

By analyzing historical data on property attributes, sales prices, and neighborhood characteristics, this project aims to create a data-driven solution that enhances market forecasting, supports investment decisions, and enables effective resource allocation.

## Business Value Proposition

The solution developed in this project offers several key benefits to stakeholders in the real estate industry:
- Improved Price Transparency: Allows sellers and buyers to set fair prices based on predictive analytics, minimizing the risk of over- or underpricing properties.
- Enhanced Decision Support: Empowers real estate agents and property developers to make informed decisions by providing insights into price trends, neighborhood desirability, and feature-specific value drivers.
- Optimized Investment Strategies: Helps investors identify high-growth areas and undervalued properties, enabling them to maximize return on investment (ROI).

## Data Analysis and Methodology
### Step 1: Data Understanding and Preparation

The dataset used in this project includes key features such as Suburb, Rooms, Type, Price, and Distance from the Central Business District (CBD). A thorough data cleansing process was conducted to handle missing values, remove redundant features, and encode categorical variables.

### Step 2: Feature Engineering

Relevant features were selected based on business relevance and statistical significance. For example
- Geographic Indicators (Suburb, Postcode): Provide insights into the impact of location on price
- Property Features (Rooms, Type, Bathroom, Car): Capture the physical attributes influencing market value.

### Step 3: Model Development and Evaluation

Two models were developed and compared to determine the optimal approach for price prediction:

- Linear Regression: A baseline model that captures linear relationships between features and price.
- Lasso Regression: A regularized model designed to handle multicollinearity and prioritize the most impactful features.

### Step 4: Out-of-Sample (OOS) Performance Evaluation

The models were assessed using key performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Cross-validation was performed to ensure model stability and reliability across different data splits.

### Step 5: Business Impact Analysis

The final models were evaluated not just on statistical performance but also on their practical business impact. The linear regression model, with its lower AIC and BIC, proved to be more effective for accurately pricing properties and informing investment strategies.

## Key Findings and Insights

- Rooms and Property Type were the strongest predictors of house prices, with more rooms and standalone houses driving up prices significantly.
- Distance from the CBD had a strong negative correlation with price, indicating that proximity to business hubs is a critical factor in Melbourneâ€™s property market.
- Neighborhood Analysis: Suburbs in Northern and Eastern regions showed higher price volatility, making them both high-risk and high-reward areas for investors.
